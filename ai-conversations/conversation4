me: what is re
ai: In Python, re is the regular expression module. It lets you search, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns.

üîπ What is it used for?

Searching for patterns in text

Replacing parts of text

Validating strings (like emails, phone numbers)

Splitting text using patterns

üîπ Basic Example
import re

text = "My email is example@gmail.com"

# Search for an email pattern
match = re.search(r'\S+@\S+\.\S+', text)
if match:
    print("Found email:", match.group())


Output:

Found email: example@gmail.com

üîπ Common Functions in re
Function	Description
re.search(pattern, string)	Search for pattern anywhere in string. Returns first match.
re.match(pattern, string)	Check if pattern matches at the beginning of the string.
re.findall(pattern, string)	Return all matches as a list.
re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)	Replace matches with something else.
re.split(pattern, string)	Split string based on a pattern.
üîπ Example: Validate phone number
phone = "123-456-7890"
if re.match(r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$', phone):
    print("Valid phone number")
else:
    print("Invalid phone number")


üí° Analogy: Think of re as a ‚Äúpattern detector‚Äù for text. You define the rules (pattern), and re finds or modifies text that matches.

  me: can i read a question using re
ai: Yes! You can use Python‚Äôs re module to read or extract a question from text.

Basically, a ‚Äúquestion‚Äù is usually a sentence that ends with a question mark ?, so you can write a regular expression to match that pattern.

Example 1 ‚Äî Extract all questions from a text
import re

text = """
What is the capital of France? I went there last year. 
Who is the president of the USA? 
Python is fun, isn‚Äôt it? Yes!
"""

# Regular expression to find sentences ending with '?'
questions = re.findall(r'[^.?!]*\?', text)

for q in questions:
    print(q.strip())


Output:

What is the capital of France?
Who is the president of the USA?
Python is fun, isn‚Äôt it?

‚úÖ How it works:

[^.?!]* ‚Üí Matches any characters except sentence-ending punctuation.

\? ‚Üí Matches a literal question mark.

re.findall() ‚Üí Finds all occurrences in the text.

Example 2 ‚Äî Check if a string is a question
def is_question(text):
    return bool(re.match(r'.*\?$', text.strip()))

print(is_question("Is this Python?"))  # True
print(is_question("This is Python."))  # False


.*\?$ ‚Üí Matches any text ending with ?.

bool(re.match(...)) ‚Üí Returns True if it‚Äôs a question.

üí° Tip: You can combine this with get_weather_data() or other functions to detect user queries that are questions, e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is the weather in Perth?‚Äù

If you want, I can write a small Python snippet that reads a paragraph and prints only the questions ‚Äî perfect for testing or parsing homework/exam questions.

  me: how can i break down the question in 3 parts and get location attribute and time
  ai: Ah! You want to parse a natural language question like:

‚ÄúWhat is the weather in Perth tomorrow?‚Äù

‚Ä¶into three parts: intent, location, and time. We can do this in Python using re, simple string parsing, or even spacy/nltk for more advanced NLP. Here‚Äôs a practical way using re and keywords.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the goal

Example question:

"What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"


Breakdown:

Intent ‚Üí ‚Äúweather‚Äù

Location ‚Üí ‚ÄúPerth‚Äù

Time ‚Üí ‚Äútoday‚Äù, ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, or a specific date

2Ô∏è‚É£ Using re to extract parts
import re

def parse_weather_question(question):
    question = question.lower()  # normalize
    intent = None
    location = None
    time = None

    # 1. Detect intent
    if re.search(r'weather', question):
        intent = 'weather'

    # 2. Detect location (assume after 'in')
    loc_match = re.search(r'in ([a-zA-Z\s]+)', question)
    if loc_match:
        location = loc_match.group(1).strip().title()

    # 3. Detect time (keywords like today, tomorrow)
    time_match = re.search(r'\b(today|tomorrow|tonight|morning|afternoon|evening)\b', question)
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1)

    return {
        "intent": intent,
        "location": location,
        "time": time
    }

# Test
q = "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"
parsed = parse_weather_question(q)
print(parsed)


Output:

{'intent': 'weather', 'location': 'Perth', 'time': 'tomorrow'}

me: how to match lower and upper without any problem
ai: Ah! You want to match text in Python regardless of case (lowercase or uppercase) without worrying about how it‚Äôs written. There are a few ways to do this, especially with regular expressions (re).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Using re.IGNORECASE (Recommended)
import re

text = "What is the Weather in Perth tomorrow?"

# Match 'weather' case-insensitively
match = re.search(r'weather', text, re.IGNORECASE)

if match:
    print("Found:", match.group())


Output:

Found: Weather


re.IGNORECASE makes the regex ignore capitalization.

Works for weather, Weather, WEATHER, etc.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert text to lowercase first
text = "What is the Weather in Perth tomorrow?"
text_lower = text.lower()

if "weather" in text_lower:
    print("Found weather")


Simple string method.

Works well for simple keyword matching.

But regex with IGNORECASE is more flexible for patterns.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Using character sets in regex (less common)
text = "What is the Weather in Perth?"
match = re.search(r'[Ww][Ee][Aa][Tt][Hh][Ee][Rr]', text)
if match:
    print("Found:", match.group())


Works but tedious for long words.

Better to use re.IGNORECASE.

‚úÖ Recommendation

For regex matching ‚Üí use re.IGNORECASE.

For simple substring search ‚Üí convert to lowercase (.lower()) and compare.
