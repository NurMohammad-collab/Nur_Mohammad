me: what is api key?
ai: An API key is essentially a secret token or code that a service gives you to identify and authenticate your application when it communicates with their API (Application Programming Interface). Think of it as a password for your app to access a service.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown:

Purpose:

Authentication: It tells the API who you are.

Authorization: Determines what your app can do with the API.

Usage tracking: Many services track API usage via keys to monitor limits or billing.

Format: Usually a long string of letters, numbers, and sometimes symbols, like:

12345abcde67890fghijk


Where it’s used:

When making requests to a web API, you often include it in the HTTP headers or as a query parameter. For example:

GET https://api.example.com/data?api_key=12345abcde67890fghijk


or

GET /data
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer 12345abcde67890fghijk


Security:

Keep it private. Anyone with your API key can potentially use your quota or access your data.

Some APIs allow generating restricted keys to limit access.

me: what is the use of matplotlib
ai: Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for creating visualizations—charts, graphs, and plots—from data. Its main purpose is to help you understand and present data visually.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of its uses:

1. Data Visualization

Allows you to turn raw data into graphs that are easier to interpret.

Examples of plots:

Line plot: show trends over time.

Bar chart: compare categories.

Histogram: show distribution of values.

Scatter plot: show relationship between two variables.

Pie chart: show proportions.

2. Customizable Plots

You can customize almost everything:

Title, labels, colors, markers, grid lines, legend, etc.

Supports multiple plots in a single figure.

3. Integration with Other Libraries

Works well with NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

Useful in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows.

4. Saving and Sharing

Plots can be saved as images (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF) to include in reports or presentations.

Example:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create a line plot
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', color='green')
plt.title("Sample Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()


This will produce a simple green line plot with labeled axes and markers.

me: how to show temperature graph from get_weather_data function
ai: Perfect! We can visualize the temperature returned by your get_weather_data() function using Python’s matplotlib library. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1️⃣ Install matplotlib (if not installed)
pip install matplotlib

2️⃣ Example Python code to plot temperature
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Suppose you already have your weather data
weather = get_weather_data("Perth", forecast_days=5)

# Extract dates and average temperatures
dates = [day['date'] for day in weather['forecast']]
temps = [float(day['avg_temp_C']) for day in weather['forecast']]

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(dates, temps, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='orange', label='Avg Temp (°C)')

# Add current temperature as a point
plt.scatter("Today", float(weather['current']['temperature_C']), color='red', label='Current Temp')
plt.text("Today", float(weather['current']['temperature_C']), f"{weather['current']['temperature_C']}°C", 
         fontsize=10, ha='center', va='bottom')

# Labels and title
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
plt.title(f"Temperature Forecast for {weather['location']}")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

✅ How it works:

dates → X-axis (forecast dates).

temps → Y-axis (average temperature per day).

plt.plot → Draws a line graph of forecast temperatures.

plt.scatter → Highlights current temperature.

Grid, labels, and legend make it readable.


me: why is y axis not stoping
ai: Ah! I see what’s happening. The Y-axis “not stopping” (going too high or too low) usually happens because Matplotlib automatically scales the axis based on the data it sees, and if you have a single point for “Current Temp” with label "Today" (instead of a proper numeric X-axis), it can confuse the axis scaling.

Here are the main reasons and fixes:

1️⃣ Cause: Mixing string and numeric X-axis
plt.scatter("Today", float(weather['current']['temperature_C']), ...)


"Today" is a string, while dates are also strings (like "2025-10-21").

Matplotlib sometimes struggles with categorical strings when plotting additional points, causing weird scaling.

Fix: Use all dates consistently. For example, treat current day as the first date in dates:

# Include current date in the dates list
dates = ["Today"] + [day['date'] for day in weather['forecast']]
temps = [float(weather['current']['temperature_C'])] + [float(day['avg_temp_C']) for day in weather['forecast']]

plt.plot(dates, temps, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='orange', label='Temperature (°C)')


Now the X-axis is consistent, and the Y-axis will automatically scale correctly.

2️⃣ Optional: Fix Y-axis range manually

If you want the Y-axis to stop at a reasonable range:

plt.ylim(min(temps) - 2, max(temps) + 2)  # adds some padding


This ensures the axis doesn’t go too high or too low.

✅ Corrected plotting code snippet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

weather = get_weather_data("Perth", forecast_days=5)

dates = ["Today"] + [day['date'] for day in weather['forecast']]
temps = [float(weather['current']['temperature_C'])] + [float(day['avg_temp_C']) for day in weather['forecast']]

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(dates, temps, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='orange', label='Temperature (°C)')

plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
plt.title(f"Temperature Forecast for {weather['location']}")
plt.ylim(min(temps)-2, max(temps)+2)  # fix y-axis range
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
